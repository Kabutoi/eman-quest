# Beta Boosters Build #5

This build went out around November 3rd, 2018. The goal of this build is to figure out which of the four variatons of battle engine are the most fun and interesting.

There are two main variations: a "Simon" type repeat-the-sequence-back engine, and an n-back based remember-the-last-three-arrows variation.

The ask is **that you fight at least three battles with both types** and give feedback on which trigger system you like more. 

# Repeat the Sequence Trigger

Much like the popular game [Simon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogZYmRdiXqs) (click for video), when monsters attack, the game presents you with a sequence of arrows. Remember as many of them correctly as you can -- each correct answer boosts your defense slightly.

Note that difficulty is adaptive, so it gets harder the better you do, and easier the worse you do.

# N-Back Trigger

The n-back trigger works quite differently. It presents you with a single arrow at a time, and asks: is this one of the last three arrows you saw?  Again, each correct answer boosts defense slightly.

For example, if it shows you an up arrow, then a right arrow, and asks you if you've seen a right-arrow before, the answer is "yes."  If it presents you four down-arrows in a row and asks you if you've seen a left-arrow, the answer is "no."

# The Ask + Bonus Points

Again, the ask is: can you fight at least three battles with each trigger, and provide feedback on likes/dislikes and which one was more/most fun (if either).

You can find enemies in the forest only; slimes and bats have drastically different characterstics, so please try to fight both.

You can use the debug menu to toggle between the two trigger types. "Sequence battle triggers" enables the Simon-type trigger, while "N-Back battle trigger" enables the n-back trigger.

If you have a few extra minutes, once you pick which of the two systems you like more, please enable the "Unlimited battle choices" option from the debug menu and fight a couple of battles

# Finally, Feedback

I would like to know:

- Which you liked more: no triggers, sequence triggers, or n-back triggers
- What you liked and disliked about each trigger
- Whether you tried unlimited battle choices, and if so, whether it was better or worse

Again, this is not hard science, I just want to know your preferences and whether you find this "fun" or not.
