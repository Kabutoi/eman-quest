Pronounced "e-maan quest." A different procedurally-generated RPG-lite with memory mechanics for battles. Born as a September 2018 monthly game development experiment.

# Gameplay Goals + Math

- Total gameplay time: ~4 hours per game
- One dungeon screen: ~5-7 minutes of gameplay
- Dungeons are 5-8 screens (25-56 minutes best/worst case respectively)
- Average time-per screen x number of screens = ~40 minutes per dungeon
- Five dungeons => ~200 minutes (3h 20m)
- Final dungeon is a single screen/battle, ~30 minutes
- Total is around ~4 hours per game
- You should get only one repeat dungeon per two games.
- Variations don't count as repeats
- Each dungeon has two variations

Notes:
- Dungeon screens are always the same size
- Seven dungeons, two variatons each, pick five per game
